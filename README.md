# ðŸª„ Nyxb UI Starter Templates

Quickly get started with a Nyxb UI starter template!

## Quick start

Head over to [Nyxb UI](https://nyxbui.design/docs/templates) to get started quickly.

## Usage

You can use `nyxbui` CLI to clone latest template to an empty directory:

```sh-session
$ npx nyxbui@latest template
```

and choose the template you want to use.

## Contribution

Each template is maintained in a branch (see [all branches](https://github.com/nuxt/starter/branches)).
For improvements, please open a Pull Request to each individual branch.

**Note:** Please avoid commiting lock-files such as `yarn.lock` and `package-lock.json` to template branches!
